# Overview of the Anaysis
We were tasked with creating a multiple-line graph in order to dispay the weekly fare data, for the ride share company, in each type of city. This will allow us to get a better understanding of the revenue recieved from each city type, so that we can make improvements inorder to maximize profits.

# Results
The following is the results of the weekly fare analysis. Based on what we can see below we collected data from the month of January all the way to April. Within this time Urban cities collected the most money followed by suburban and then rural. All 3 cities seemed fairly consistent throughout the 3 months ![](https://github.com/RonHolcomb/PyBer-Ride-Share/blob/main/Fig8.png)

# Summary
The following are 3 business recommendations based on the provided data that can help the disparities between the 3 city types and maximize revenue.
1. I would lower the fare price in urban cities. This will allow us to get more customers and stay competitve in a saturated market by being a cheaper option.
2. Using the revenue generated by urban and suburban areas I would hire more drivers and raise the price in rural areas. This will allow us to gain more profits on smaller cities as wel as control a market with little competition.
3. I would fluxuate the price of suburban rides based on the location that they are going. Rides to urban areas will cost more, the customer will understand as they are being taken to a popular and more dense area, but be happy to learn that the ride back will be cheaper. On the other hand rides to rural areas will cost less, but put them in an area where we have more drivers than the competition, so they will have to take a more expensive ride back.
